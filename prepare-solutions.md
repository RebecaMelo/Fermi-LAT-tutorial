Solutions to exercises: Obtaining and preparing LAT data for your favorite source
=====================================================

## Exercise 1

This is one simple way of looping through the columns and printing them out:

```python
events=hdulist[1].data
n=events['ENERGY'].size # size of array

for i in range(n):
	print(i,events['ENERGY'][i], events['RA'][i], events['DEC'][i], events['TIME'][i])
```

## Exercise 2

```python
hist(events['ZENITH_ANGLE'],100)
xlabel('Zenith angle (degrees)')
```

## Exercise 3

Using IPython:

```python
import pyfits

# read FITS file
hducut = pyfits.open('[SOURCE]_filtered_gti.fits')
eventscut=hdunew[1].data

# plot
hist(eventscut['ZENITH_ANGLE'],100)
xlabel('Zenith angle (degrees)')
```

When comparing this histogram with the one generated in the previous exercise, notice the impact of the zenith angle cut.

## Exercise 4

Assuming you ran the previous exercises in the same IPython environment, we will reuse the previously generated variables:

```python
# we read both events files
before0 = pyfits.open('[SOURCE]_PH00.fits')
before1 = pyfits.open('[SOURCE]_PH01.fits')
# total number of events summing from both events files
nbefore=before0[1].data['ENERGY'].size+before1[1].data['ENERGY'].size
print("Number of events before the cut",nbefore)

# now we deal with the events file after the data cuts
after = pyfits.open('[SOURCE]_filtered_gti.fits')
nafter=after[1].data['ENERGY'].size
print("Number of events after the cut",nafter)
```

Note that we have way less counts now than before performing the data preparation. The reason is that  we considered only events which have good qualityâ€”i.e. high probability of being astrophysical photons (event class and event type selection). Most importantly, we also removed the Earth limb photons and considered only photons with appropriate GTI values.
