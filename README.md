Analysis of Fermi LAT data: Hands on session
==============================================

These are the tutorials for the hands on, practical session on the analysis of *Fermi* Large Area Telescope (aka LAT) gamma-ray observations for the [São Paulo School of Advanced Science on High Energy and Plasma Astrophysics in the CTA Era](http://www.astro.iag.usp.br/~highenastro/). The goal of this activity is to give you a concrete overview and get you started on the analysis of Fermi LAT data. 

This activity has a total duration of 4 hours distributed in two days. Given the somewhat short duration of these sessions, we will not have time to get into the details of all the fascinating science behind the analysis. The emphasis is on “getting your hands dirty” with the data.
